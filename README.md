The quickest way to get started is to run an HTTPS server on the same machine as your browser, 
listening on port 4443 (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/19706670 for an example), then load 
https://localhost:4443/ and click through to accept the self-signed certificate.

For other uses, follow the instructions in apikey.js.
